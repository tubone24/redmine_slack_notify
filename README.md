## Background


In the workplace where I work, I use Redmine built in a private environment for sharing information between stakeholders.

I wanted to share the update of Redmine Issue and its contents to Slack used by the development team,

Since Redmine server can only be accessed in a private environment, Slack's RSS Integration could not be used.

So, I thought about creating a Python script that runs on the PC (Raspberry PI) that was left behind in development, and notified Redmine of updates via the script.

## Install

### Precondition

- Python3.6 or more

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

WEB_HOOK_URL_DAILY=https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxxxx       # Incoming WEBHOOK for Daily notify
